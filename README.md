# Why Java Is an Ideal Choice for AI Field?
Java plays a vital role in powering AI applications due to its unique features that make it a popular choice for developing ML models. The main benefits that make Java a popular choice for AI include:
<br>
<br>
**Ability to solve complex tasks:** Java is an object-oriented language, which means it can represent complex real-world entities and processes in a natural and intuitive way.
<br>
<br>
**Enhanced security:** The language provides advanced security features such as sandboxing, access control, and code signing, making it a secure choice for developing applications that deal with sensitive data.
<br>
<br>
**Easy maintainability:** Properly-documented Java applications are easier to maintain due to precise programming capabilities.
<br>
<br>
**Built-in garbage collection:** Since Java can automatically delete useless data, itâ€™s a perfect choice when it comes to developing large-scale projects.
<br>
<br>
**Seamless portability:** Java is platform-independent, which makes it easy to run the same code on different operating systems and hardware architectures. This feature is especially important for AI applications that require scalability and performance across multiple devices and platforms.
